== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is important to backup my website? =

The majority of people value their digital content, but are still not backing it up regularly. More than 50% of adults, personally have and/or know someone who has lost files.

The fact is that, even though today's technology is extraordinarily advanced and dependable, it can still fall subject to failure. So unless you have a routine backup solution, you're at risk of losing all of your data at a moment's notice.

= How often should a backup be created? =

It depends on how often data gets updated on your website. Maybe daily backups are not necessary and maybe monthly backups are not good enough, so the best way is measuring the amount of data that gets changed in your particular case.

= What is included in the basic (free) plan? =

Backup Guard Free gives you the ability to backup or restore your website as many times as you want. You can also download your backups and import them in other websites where Backup Guard is installed and running.

= Why should I purchase Backup Guard Pro? =

Although Backup Guard Free gives you the ability to backup and restore your website as many times as you want, your backups will only reside on your server. With our Pro plans you can upload your backups to the cloud of your preference, schedule your backups, receive notifications, and many other features.

That's not all, if you are a paid user, you will receive priority/emergency support and finally, only with our Platinum plan, you will receive "unlimited plans" license which will allow you to install Backup Guard on as many websites as you want.

= What are the minimum requirements for installing Backup Guard? =

Your hosting/server must have installed PHP 5.3 or higher with zlib library enabled.

= What are the limitations of the backup created by Backup Guard? =

Of course there is a limit regarding the size of the archive, but practically it is unreachable. We use our own SGBP archive format which compared to Zip doesn't limit you to 4GB archive/file size or 65k of number of files.

It doesn't matter if you are running 32-bit or 64-bit OS, if it's Linux, Windows or Mac, everything is the same.

= Something is not working, what should I do? =

No software is perfect and we are not the exception. There are tons of different servers and configurations and something may go wrong in one of them.

When you are facing an issue of any kind with any of our products, the first thing to do is <a href="https://backup-guard.com/support">contacting us</a>. We are here to help you, give you tips, advices and even create fixes/patches or features whenever needed.

= How can I extract an SGBP file? =

SGBP is our own archive format, therefore currently there is no software that can extract it.

= Is it possible to migrate website using Backup Guard? =

Although we don't offer server migration feature, Backup Guard creates an exact snapshot of the current state of your website and whenever you restore it, the exact same state gets restored. So practically, you can migrate your website with just downloading and importing your backup.
