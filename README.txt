== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is important to backup my website? =

The majority of people value their digital content, but are still not backing it up regularly. More than 50% of adults, personally have and/or know someone who has lost files.

The fact is that, even though today's technology is extraordinarily advanced and dependable, it can still fall subject to failure. So unless you have a routine backup solution, you're at risk of losing all of your data at a moment's notice.

= How often should a backup be created? =

It depends on how often data gets updated on your website. Maybe daily backups are not necessary and maybe monthly backups are not good enough, so the best way is measuring the amount of data that gets changed in your particular case.

= What is included in the basic (free) plan? =

Backup Guard Free gives you the ability to backup or restore your website as many times as you want. You can also download your backups and import them in other websites where Backup Guard is installed and running.

= Why should I purchase Backup Guard Pro? =

Although Backup Guard Free gives you the ability to backup and restore your website as many times as you want, your backups will only reside on your server. With our Pro plans you can upload your backups to the cloud of your preference, schedule your backups, receive notifications, and many other features.

That's not all, if you are a paid user, you will receive priority/emergency support and finally, only with our Platinum plan, you will receive "unlimited plans" license which will allow you to install Backup Guard on as many websites as you want.

= What other platforms has Backup Guard planned to support? =

We currently support WordPress and Magento platforms, but with the help of our flexible and universal backup technology, multi-platform coverage is just around the corner. Prestashop and Joomla are next.

= What are the minimum requirements for installing Backup Guard? =

Your hosting/server must have installed PHP 5.3 or higher with zlib library enabled.

Note: depending on the product you are using, there more be more requirements, that's why we recommend you to check our products section for more details.

= What are the limitations of the backup created by Backup Guard? =

Of course there is a limit regarding the size of the archive, but practically it is unreachable. We use our own SGBP archive format which compared to Zip doesn't limit you to 4GB archive/file size or 65k of number of files.

It doesn't matter if you are running 32-bit or 64-bit OS, if it's Linux, Windows or Mac, everything is the same.

= Something is not working, what should I do? =

No software is perfect and we are not the exception. There are tons of different servers and configurations and something may go wrong in one of them.

When you are facing an issue of any kind with any of our products, the first thing to do is <a href="https://backup-guard.com/support">contacting us</a>. We are here to help you, give you tips, advices and even create fixes/patches or features whenever needed.

= How can I extract an SGBP file? =

SGBP is our own archive format, therefore currently there is no software that can extract it.

= Is it possible to migrate website using Backup Guard? =

Although we don't offer server migration feature, Backup Guard creates an exact snapshot of the current state of your website and whenever you restore it, the exact same state gets restored. So practically, you can migrate your website with just downloading and importing your backup.

<p><strong>Perform manual backup</strong><br>
If you want to create a backup manually, follow these steps:</p>

<p>
1. Click on the green "Perform manual backup" button.<br>
2. Select "Full backup" if you want to perform a full backup of your website (files and database), otherwise select "Custom backup" to be able to choose what you really want to backup.<br>
3. (PRO) Select "Upload to cloud" option if you want to upload your backup to any of your already connected clouds. Note: "Background mode" option will give you the possibility to backup in a low priority mode, consuming fewer resources from your system.<br>
4. Click on the "Backup" button to start the backup.<br>
5. You will be able to see the progress of each step and cancel the backup if needed.
</p>

<p><strong>Import backups from local computer</strong><br>
If you have an SGBP file in your PC and you want to import it into your website, follow these steps:</p>

<p>
1. Click on the blue "Import" button.<br>
2. Browse the file in your local computer. There are 2 things to notice here: a) the maximum upload size will vary depending on the server your website is running on, b) a path is indicated where you can easily upload your file using an FTP client of your preference (the file will be automatically detected).<br>
3. Press the "Upload" button and wait for your file to be uploaded.
</p>

Restoring is as easy as backing up. Just follow these instructions:</p>

<p>
1. Localize the backup file you want to restore from.<br>
2. Click on the green restore button.<br>
3. After confirmation, the restore progress will start. Note: it is highly recommended that you don't do anything else during the restore progress, because the site is in alteration process and any secondary action can affect its correct restoration.

4. After that, you will be redirected back to your website, where the switch has turned on.<br>
5. Starting from now, you will be able to choose this cloud as an upload destination of your backup files. Note: you can change the name of the destination folder at the top of the "Cloud" section.
</p>

<p><strong>Authorize and connect to FTP (PRO)</strong><br>
Follow these instructions if you want to be able to upload your backups directly to your FTP server:</p>
